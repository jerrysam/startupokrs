		                    <p class="lead">– Angus Davis with First Round<br></p><p class="lead">This is a case study of how Swipely, a restaurant management platform (now called Upserve) used OKRs to drive growth at a critical moment as the company grew from 30 to 80 employees in one year. CEO Angus Davis turned to OKRs to keep the young company on track and raise everyone’s game.<br>Davis argues that while every company’s OKR strategy is different, the founding principles don’t change. He stresses the importance of making company and personal goals public, so that employees aren’t working in a vacuum. “Having public goals forces different types of thinking around how people ask for help from others,” says Davis.<br>Davis kick-started the process by personally creating a series of ‘archetype’ OKR examples to share with colleagues. These included a ‘description’ of each objective, fleshing out its significance, and a piece on ‘alignment’ demonstrating how individual objectives aligned with company-wide goals. Davis insisted everyone include at least one skill development objective in their OKRs to foster a culture of constant coaching.<br>This 12-minute article provides a detailed case study of one company’s adoption of OKRs and demonstrates how the process can keep a rapidly growing startup on track. Davis’s ‘archetype’ OKR examples are useful food for thought. Some of his key results may offend purists, because they include actions, not results (‘Review training materials’; ‘Do a role-playing session’) confirming Davis’s point is that ‘every OKR strategy is different.’<br></p><p class="lead">Read Article</p>

		                    </p><p class="lead">This article offers valuable OKR tips from Jeff Weiner – the man who grew LinkedIn into a company worth more than $20 billion. Weiner replaced Reid Hoffman as CEO of LinkedIn in late 2008 and played a central role in the social media giant’s acquisition by Microsoft for $26.2 billion in June 2016. He was once recognised as one of the ‘top 10 CEOs at US tech companies’ by Glassdoor.<br>In this article – which draws on statements made by Weiner at a First Round Capital CEO Summit – the renowned businessman explains how to use OKRs to put your company mission into action. He stresses that an inspiring vision – while crucial for getting a business up and running – can only take you so far. You need the right processes in place to actually succeed in the long-term.<br>Weiner drives home the importance of ensuring OKRs are truly embedded in the company culture. Establishing company values is great, but if those values get easily tossed to the wayside then teams will lose motivation. He also gives an insight into how OKRs are measured at LinkedIn. He stresses the importance of regular ‘strategic deep dives’ and separating tactics from strategy so that teams aren’t constantly switching between long-term and short-term thinking.<br>At around 2,000 words, this article is an 8-minute read and a must for any team leader looking to borrow some of LinkedIn’s OKR magic.<br></p><p class="lead">Read Article<br></p>

		                    <p class="lead">&nbsp;- by Luke Kanies, Founder at Puppet
		                    </p><p class="lead">Luke Kanies walks us through his experience of executing OKRs at his IT automation company, Puppet, which partners with organizations such as Amazon Web Services, Cisco and Microsoft Azure. Kanies is open about the mistakes the organisation made while implementing OKRs for the first time, and is thoughtful about what they could have done better.<br>After Kanies first became familiar with Doerr’s planning system, he felt he was missing some key information: How do you make and update OKRs? Should the CEO develop them; or the executive team; or the frontline people? And how long should you spend developing them? How often should you update them? Maybe it doesn’t matter, but you still have to make a choice, says Kanies. <br>Kanies explains how the team at Puppet decided on their OKRs and went about implementing their strategy. Kanies imparts some of the things he wished he’d done differently -- for example, he regrets running the OKR process himself until the company hit 250 people, as this made the organisation ‘too centralised’. He also identifies some of the early mistakes Puppet made, such as not assigning each objective to an individual, and creating team goals rather than company goals, which encouraged a silo mentality.<br>An invaluable case study for anyone looking to introduce OKRs to their company who wants to learn from another founder’s mistakes.

		                    </p><p class="lead">In this 2010 interview with The New York Times, Mark Pincus, founder and chief executive of games company Zynga, which was established in 2007 and is best known for its hugely successful games FarmVille and Zynga Poker, explains how the business harnessed OKRs to inspire a deeper level of engagement among employees. Pincus thinks of OKRs as ‘individual roadmaps’ that help keep people focused ‘on the three things that matter – not the ten.’<br>Pincus’s weekly approach differs slightly from the traditional OKR model. ‘I ask everybody to write down on Sunday night or Monday morning what are [their] three priorities for the week,’ he explains in the interview, ‘and then on Friday see how [they] did against them.’ He found that this system keeps teams motivated and on track without pushing them to the point of burnout.<br>While the interview itself is fairly brief, it provides a valuable insight into how CEOs can adjust the OKR model to best suit their company. Pincus also offers up useful tips on managing teams. He stresses the importance of ensuring colleagues feel complete ownership of the goals they’ve been set. <br><br></p><p class="lead">Read Article</p>

		                    <p class="lead">
		                        – Richard McLean
		                    </p><p class="lead">Richard McLean is Senior Director of Business Operations at Elsevier – the world’s leading publisher of science and health information – where his focus is on product strategy implementation and performance. Prior to that, he led strategic programmes in numerous senior roles in the public sector. Elsevier was using OKRs, but they were new to McLean. After a few months in his new role, McClean wrote this case study outlining the top four things he’d learnt about OKRs. His insights are nuanced and sometimes challenge established thinking.<br>His first takeaway is the importance of separating objectives and activities into two different ‘buckets’ – a tip from OKR coach Felipe Castro. Visualising them in this way makes you ‘less wedded to the activities you’re currently doing’ and ‘freer to ask whether they are the right ones’, McLean writes. His second is that you shouldn’t cascade objectives down through levels of management – he argues it’s slow and reinforces a ‘top-down, command and control way of working’; just make sure each team’s OKRs are aligned with the company OKRs. His third is the importance of keeping objectives and metrics separate, something Christina Wodtke advocates. Finally, although some argue that OKRs and individual compensation should be completely separate, McLean says he found that total separation unhelpful – it’s almost inevitable, he writes, that OKRs are at least a factor in someone’s performance review.<br>McClean clearly knows his stuff, referencing John Doerr, Christina Wodtke and Felipe Castro throughout his article, which also offers a useful link to McLean’s OKR reading list. A short, 9-minute read, full of fresh ideas and useful tips.&nbsp;<br></p><p class="lead">

		                    </p><p class="lead">Ben Lamorte, the founder of OKRs.com, is a renowned OKR coach who’s worked with top organisations including Cisco, eBay and Booking.com. Lamorte wrote this white paper in 2013, when many of his clients began asking him if there was a book on OKRs they could turn to (there was a renewed surge of interest in OKRs in 2013 after a video of Google’s Rick Lau’s workshop presentation on OKRs went viral).The result is this very practical step-by-step guide of how to implement OKRs at your organisation, with examples of how they should work in action. The guide focuses on how OKRs help communicate the organisation’s core strategy and get everyone aligned, providing clarity about the significance of people’s work and making their contribution visible to everyone.<br>Topics covered also include the “Ten Characteristics of Effective OKRs”; a guide to grading key results; and the steps required for an OKR rollout.<br>Lamorte’s guide is easy to navigate, with clearly labelled sections and concise, to-the-point explanations, and is great if you are looking for a clearly laid out OKR guide with minimal fluff. Understandably, the guide promotes the benefits of OKR coaching, but the case study of one of Lamorte’s team’s coaching sessions with an engineering team in a large software company is an interesting illustration of real-life OKR implementation.<br>The white paper/guide is available in full on the URL above or you can download a PDF version in exchange for your email address and some organisational details.<br><br></p><p class="lead">

Useful topics include ‘How ambitious should your OKRs be?’ and ‘Why you should separate OKR and compensation.’ The guide also looks at the connection between strategic and tactical OKRs and the importance of having value-based rather than activity-based OKRs (because the end result should be ‘success’ rather than ‘tasks achieved.’)<br>Castro created the concept of the OKR Cycle and gives readers a detailed outline of what a typical OKR Cycle should look like.<br>This guide is mainly aimed at first-time OKR users, but seasoned OKR users will also find it valuable as a recap of key elements. The guide is downloadable for free on Castro’s website and runs to 50 pages of PDF. It is around a 30-minute read, though a team could usefully spend a morning or a day working through it section by section and considering how to use OKRs in their own context.<br></p><p class="lead">

This guide shows how Google uses OKRs to get people out of their comfort zones and track progress towards achieving ambitious goals.<br>The guide covers the basics of OKRs and offers tips on introducing OKRs to any organisation. It includes advice on setting objectives and developing key results and team OKRs. It warns against goals that don't ‘push for new achievements’, examples being ‘maintain market position’ or ‘continue doing X’, or low-value objectives that won’t make much difference to an organisation even when achieved.<br>The inclusion of a downloadable spreadsheet and scorecard are useful if you are new to OKRs and want practical advice on how to grade OKRs effectively. Google uses a scale of 0.0 to 1.0, where a 0.0 designates a failure a 1.0 score means that the objective is ‘fully achieved’. If someone consistently achieves their objectives, this suggests OKRs need to be more ambitious:  a ‘sweet spot’ of around 0.6-0.7 is recommended.<br>The guide has nine slides and can be read quite quickly; it also rewards closer reading and reflection. The last slide offers the now-famous 81-minute 2012 video of a presentation by Rick Klau, Google Ventures partner, presenting “How Google sets goals”, which is also reviewed here.<br></p><p class="lead">Read Guide</p>

The Estonian start-up behind it was founded in 2009 and previously won backing from the likes of Ahti Heinla, founding engineer of Skype, and Taavi Lepmets, a former investor of Russia’s largest social network Odnoklassniki.<br>Weekdone has created a host of resources for organisations, including this step-by-step guide aimed at helping teams get to grips with ‘the big and small’ of OKRs. The Weekdone team say that the guide will ‘give you the foundation you need to master both the methodology and the method.’ As such it’s a run-through of everything you need to get started on OKRs – from how to define objectives and key results to a brief history of OKRs to understanding the difference between outputs and outcomes.<br>Weekdone’s guide goes into a little more depth than some of the other step-by-step guides out there. For example, it breaks down the concept of alignment and why linking OKRs is so critical for organisational success. It then explains how to create company-wide buy-in into company objectives and ensure that all subsequent team objectives feed into them.<br>To get your free copy of the guide, you’ll need to input your name, email address and company.

		                    <p class="lead">
		                        – WhatMatters.com
		                    </p><p class="lead">This playbook, featured on John Doerr’s WhatMatters.com, is drawn from internal Google sources and reprinted with their permission. As the introduction says, ‘No one has more collective experience in implementing OKRs than Google.’<br>The Guide explores some of the most common OKR-writing mistakes. One is writing ‘Low Value Objectives’ (also called ‘Who Cares? OKRs) – objectives that, if achieved, wouldn’t actually make a difference to the business. Others include ‘Business as Usual OKRs’, ‘Sandbagging’ (meeting all OKRs because teams are hoarding resources or are not fully stretched) and having insufficient key results to ensure the objective is delivered – it is easy to write KRs that are ‘necessary but not sufficient’ to achieve the objective.<br>The guide distinguishes between committed and aspirational OKRs. Google separates its undisputed goals from those that reflect how the company would like the world to look, even if they don’t know how to get there are whether there are sufficient resources available. The expected score for a committed OKR is a 1.0 – because the company will ‘adjust schedules and resources’ if necessary, to achieve them – while the expected score for an aspirational OKR is 0.7.<br>Google has been using OKRs since venture capitalist John Doerr introduced them to the young company in 1999. Your own approach to OKRs may well be different, but it’s very helpful to get a glimpse at the methodologies the tech giant has developed over the years and the pitfalls they’ve encountered along the way. There is some Google jargon; the KR ‘Double fleet-wide Y by launching X to 90+ percent of borg cells’ is a personal favourite.<br></p><p class="lead">Read Guide</p>

		                    <p>
		                        – Rick Klau
		                    </p><p>Rick Klau, senior operating partner at Google Ventures, joined the company through its acquisition of Feedburner in 2007 and immediately found himself thrown into the OKR cycle. Now an OKR veteran, Klau delivered this Startup Labs workshop presentation in 2011; the video was posted on YouTube in 2012.<br>Klau’s presentation has been credited for a resurgence of interest in OKRs and is something of a classic. Klau kicks off with a selection of slides from the original 1999 presentation made by venture capitalist John Doerr to Larry Page, Sergei Brin and others after Doerr had bought equity in the one-year-old Google and hoped to persuade them to adopt OKRs to keep the organisation focussed on its ambitious goals.<br>Klau gives an insider’s view of the key benefits of OKRs, particularly the focus and discipline they provide about what really matters, and Doerr’s original insistence that OKRs should ideally be ‘negotiated’ between individuals and their team managers, not ‘dictated’. Lau mentions Doerr’s suggestion that 60% of an organisation’s OKRs should be ‘bottom up’ and adds his own view that the figure should be ‘at least half.’<br>The embedded presentation from Doerr uses the example of an American football team to illustrate how overarching organisational OKRs feed into the objectives of the rest of the organisation – which can be confusing if you are not familiar with ‘passing attacks’ and ‘punt returns.’ At 81 minutes it’s a long watch – the first 35 minutes are the most focused on the principles and history of OKRs; the rest explores Klau’s role as product manager for Google Blogger. But this presentation’s classic status makes it well worth a view.<br></p>

		                    <p>
		                        – Christina Wodtke
		                    </p><p>Christina Wodtke, author of the bestselling book Radical Focus: Achieving Your Most Important Goals with Objectives and Key Results, is one of the world’s most renowned OKR coaches. She teaches start-ups all over the world how to build high-performing teams through OKR methodology, using the knowledge she picked up while leading redesigns and initial product offerings at top companies like LinkedIn, Yahoo! and Zynga.<br>In this video, Wodtke explains what it takes to create a culture where employees genuinely want to push themselves to achieve company goals. Using a fictional startup as an example, Wodtke guides you through how to define your objectives and key results and some common mistakes people make when they first use OKRs. She reminds us that objectives must be a qualitative, not a number (because most people are not inspired by numbers) and that one goal per quarter is enough for a small team – ‘the thing you don’t want to drop.’ She has an interesting suggestion: many organisations review progress on Fridays; Wodke recommends using Monday as the best day for promises and commitments and keeping Fridays as a day for celebrating as a team. ‘Everybody needs bragging time,’ she says. ‘It motivates you to have something to share, and makes you feel like you’re part of something special.’ <br>This 30-minute video is an engaging introduction to OKRs, and a good way to catch up on Wodtke’s thinking if you can’t commit to reading Radical Focus. Nothing happens between 9.00-14.00 mins because the workshop audience are doing their OKR exercise off-camera: skip this! The Q&amp;A session at the end (22.40) is interesting.<br></p>

		                    <p>- by Henrik-Jan van der Pol</p><p>Henrik-Jan van der Pol is the CEO of OKR software company Perdoo. Previously a management consultant, he first became interested in OKRs after seeing how frequently leaders fail to unite teams behind company goals.<br>Van der Pol delivers a refreshing and humorous presentation to the OKR Forum in Amsterdam in 2019 on the common failures and pitfalls of OKR implementation. ‘Who here has found OKRs an overnight success?’ he asks the Forum. Everyone laughs; few delegates raise their hands.<br>Van der Pol talks about the ‘actual pain’ of implementing OKR programmes and highlights three common mistakes. The first is to assume that OKRs are a silver bullet. The second is to rush the process of setting OKRs, while Pol sees the quarterly process of creating OKRs as a major benefit, recommending taking one week per quarter in the early stages. Finally, Pol warns against using OKRs to measure ‘everything’. OKRs represent the road map to take us to our destination, van der Pol says, while checking the petrol gauge to make sure you have enough petrol is a KPI. OKRs are a tool that translates strategy into goals; KPIs are a metric that shows the business is running smoothly.<br>Van der Pol shares his top 7 tips to make an OKR programme a success – one of which, radically, is that if a team new to OKRs is struggling with stretch objectives, ‘ditch them’. Choose a more achievable objective and shoot for stretch at a later stage.<br>This is an original ‘what-not-to-do’ presentation from someone with years of experience helping companies execute their OKR programmes.&nbsp;<br></p>

		                    <p>– TED Talk by John Doerr</p><p>John Doerr is the renowned investor and Chairman of venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins. He is widely acknowledged to be responsible for the spread of the OKR system though Silicon Valley.<br>Doerr first learnt about OKRs in the 1970s while working as an intern at Intel under the legendary Andy Grove who, as Doerr says in this talk, has been called ‘the greatest manager of his or of any other era’. Doerr introduced the founders of Google to OKRs after investing $12 million in the one-year-old startup for Kleiner in 1999. Since then, he has helped dozens of companies adopt the system – including Dropbox, Spotify, LinkedIn and Twitter.<br>In this engaging 2018 TED talk, Doerr argues that we fail to achieve our goals because we do not set the right goals in the first place. He walks us through the fundamentals of OKRs and explains how the goal-setting system can drive us towards positive change and help us face even the world’s toughest challenges, from global poverty to disease. Using healthcare technology company Nuna’s founder, Jini Kim, and Bono’s ONE organisation as examples, Doerr argues that we need to ask not only What? (objectives) and How? (key results), but also Why? (our purpose). ‘Truly transformational teams combine their ambitions [with] their passions and their purpose,’ says Doerr.<br>This inspirational eleven-minute video is an opportunity to see the great man in action (and to see a short video clip of Andy Grove himself) and is a particularly good resource if you’re looking to galvanise a team adopting OKRs.  <br><br></p>

		                    <p class="lead">Giant Talk is the world’s first OKR podcast. Created by OKR consultancy There Be Giants, this weekly podcast explores OKR methodology and features conversations with industry experts like Reid Koster, OKR Practice Lead at Betterworks, and Matt Roberts, founder of the OKR platform ZOKRI. This series has 70 episodes so far and covers many interesting topics including psychological safety and why it matters for OKR execution, cross-functional OKRs, and the importance of company values.<br>To get started, try this 22-minute-long episode on “The importance of the OKR coach role”. In it, Roger, the founder of There be Giants, and Georgia, the company’s Culture Guru, explain why every organisation needs one team member to act as ‘the custodian of best practice’ of OKR execution – someone who helps teams create their OKRs and ensures alignment between management and employees. Without this, they argue, much of the initial enthusiasm for OKRs will wear thin over time – so it’s worth establishing early on who this key figure will be.<br>There is some variation in the quality of the episodes so exercise your own judgement here. With the exception of the odd mini-series, every episode is different so there’s no need to start at the very beginning of the series – just dive into the podcasts that sound most relevant to you and your organisation.<br><br></p>
